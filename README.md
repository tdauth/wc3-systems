# wc3-systems

Ideas for Warcraft III: Reforged systems for custom maps.

## Systems

### Idle Icon System

[Idle Icon System](https://github.com/tdauth/wc3-idle-icon-system): Custom idle icons for warrior types, heroes etc. inspired by games like AoM.

### Votekick system

[Votekick System](https://github.com/tdauth/wc3-votekick-system): Allows starting a votekick against a player with "-votekick X" where X is the player number or color. Typing "-yes" approves the votekick. By default, if more than half or players vote "-yes" he/she is kicked from the game. There is a time limit how long the votekick lasts and every player has a cooldown on how often he/she can start a votekick. Besides, there is a global votekick cooldown/only one votekick at a time.
This could also be based on a more general vote system.

### Multiboard Stats system

Multiboard based system which allows you to configure columns and lines with predefined stuff like: Player name, hero level, gold, lumber, unit kills etc.

### Player Stats system

Show player score and team score like in AoE which can be hidden with a button.

### Mock system

Allows sending mocks via chat, enabling/disabling them and easily configure sounds with texts from the original game.
